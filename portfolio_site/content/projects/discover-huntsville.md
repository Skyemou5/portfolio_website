date: 2024-03-01T21:08:01-07:00
summary: Discover Huntsville is an AR app I helped create as a tech artist and programmer. I created procedural assets in houdini for the AR experience, designed NPR shaders, and coded in C# using Unity. Additionally I participated in planning and communication between teams and gave presentations and updates during meetings.

## Project Overview
Discover Huntsville is an app developed during my internship with Trideum. The application serves as a tourist guide, helping users explore the city of Huntsville, Alabama, and connect with local art and businesses.

## Overall Contributions
During my internship, I held roles as a 3D Generalist, Technical Artist, and Programmer. My contributions were pivotal in various aspects of the project, including 3D content generation, pipeline optimization, and programming major components of the app.

## Technologies Used
The project utilized several technologies, including:
- Unity
- Mapbox
- Maya
- Blender
- Houdini

## Background
My selection for this internship was influenced by my role in a previous group project overseen by Trideum. My ability to connect technologies, develop pipelines, and optimize workflows proved instrumental in my success at UVU and as a team member at Trideum.

## Specific Contributions
### 3D Content Generation with Houdini & Maya
- Generated 3D content using Houdini and Maya, enriching the app with visually appealing assets.




### Pipeline Optimization
- Developed efficient pipelines to streamline the development process, ensuring smooth workflows and timely delivery of assets.

### Programming in C#
- Utilized C# programming to build major components of the app, enhancing its functionality and user experience.
- One of my main contributions was working on a custom UI layer that would work more like a conventional mobile app. I learned how to better use some of the more advanced features of C# like generics.
- I also helped to implement the Mapbox Api into unity, which took some considerable reworking for it to work for our use-case.
