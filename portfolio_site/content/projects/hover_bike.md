### Project Overview
This final project for my introduction to 3D modeling course at UVU was a comprehensive journey into 3D design and animation. I transformed my original concept art into a detailed 3D model of a sci-fi hover bike with an animated robotic welding arm, showcasing my creativity and problem-solving skills within Maya.

### Tools Used
- Maya: 3D Modeling, Rigging, Animation, UVs
- Substance Painter: Texturing and surfacing
- Sketchfab: Presentation and Animation Showcase
- Blender: Cycles renders


### Project Details

#### Concept and Design
Started with concept art, moving from sketches to a fully-realized sci-fi hover bike and robotic arm, blending my vision with practical 3D modeling techniques.

#### Modeling Techniques in Maya
Developed the hover bike's form using basic shapes and subdivision modeling to achieve an organic, futuristic machine aesthetic. Faced and overcame Maya's quirks with cable modeling, mirroring, and model repairs.

#### Rigging and Animation
Self-initiated rigging and animation of a robotic welding arm created a dynamic workshop scene. Despite challenges with piston animation, the project was a significant learning experience in Maya's animation capabilities.

#### Texturing and Materials
While my early work with textures and materials was less optimized, affecting Sketchfab loading times, it laid a strong foundation for my understanding of texturing principles.

#### Overcoming Maya's Quirks
Navigated the technical hurdles inherent in Maya, refining my problem-solving approach and deepening my understanding of the software.

#### Sketchfab Integration
Learned to configure and present an animated 3D model on Sketchfab, enhancing my skills in 3D content presentation for the web.

### Challenges
Grappled with Maya's learning curve, managing complex rigging systems and animation while juggling the intricate details of the hover bike's design.

### Outcome
This project was a testament to my ability to see a complex 3D model from concept to completion. The skills I honed contributed to my acceptance into UVU's esteemed game and animation program and have significantly influenced my approach to 3D art. The quality of this project helped me get into the games and animation program at UVU.
