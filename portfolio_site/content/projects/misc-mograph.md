A collection of some of motion graphics clips I've made over the years. They may or may not get their own entries someday.

These are a mix of Houdini and Blender projects, sometimes both were used. They were all a lot of fun.

## Houdini Growth Solver

Played around in Houdini to create this coral growth solver. It's all about point propagation in a volume, branching out into intricate dendrites. I looooove generative art, so crafting this growth solver was a real treat, watching the algorithmic art take on a life of its own.

## Sword Scene

I put together a short clip with a bit of a fantasy twist, The cloth on the handle is simulated which was fun. I was going for that mystical vibe, where the sword's presence alone seems to make the ground pulse and burn with energy. There's a nod the design of a dagger in Riven in the sword design.
