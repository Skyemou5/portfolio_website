This is just a collection of some of the smaller projects I've done over the years that I think are fun to look at and somewhat interesting.

## Legos

I've always had a thing for those see-through Legos, and the red window piece? Total eye-candy. It’s all about the way they glow when the light hits just right. Had to give the bricks a drop in a quick animation – nothing beats the clink and clatter of Legos coming together, even if it's just on screen.

## Abstract Machine

"Abstract Machine" is a piece where I've let my imagination roam into the realm of the unfathomable. It's my visualization of a machine of such complexity and consciousness that it might just underpin reality itself. The intricate, swirling forms and enigmatic vibrations hint at a higher machination that molds our existence, or perhaps we're fleeting thoughts in its grand, unknowable consciousness. The artwork invites a dive into the idea of an intelligence so vast and alien, it blurs the lines between the animate and inanimate.

## Mantra/Houdini Glass Sphere Cluster

An exploration of refraction and light in 3D rendering, this project uses glass spheres to create interesting refractions.

## Pastel Toon Cyberpunk

"Pastel Toon Cyberpunk" is my nod to Moebius, where I've tried to channel his knack for outlines and punchy colors into a scene that's cyberpunk at its core but with a twist. I wanted to blend the grunge of a cyberpunk city's daily grind with something softer.

## Bishops Ring

This project visualizes the concept of a Bishops Ring, a theoretical ring-structured space habitat, using Blender. The procedural noise creates detailed terrain within the structure.

## Broken Wine Glass

Illustrating the moment of fragility with a focus on realism, this render captures the detailed texture and transient nature of glass.

## Abstract Sphere and Ocean

Merging the organic with the abstract, this project contrasts textures and forms.

## Mantra Cube Blob

Fusing organic and geometric forms, this project demonstrates the dynamic interplay of structured and fluid elements in 3D rendering.

## Bionicle Mask

I revisited a bit of my childhood with this Bionicle mask, spicing it up with some realistic textures and sci-fi decals for kicks. It's not just a trip down memory lane but a fun exercise in photorealism—adding imperfections to give it history and some neon because, well, who doesn't like neon?

## Fractal Brain

"Fractal Brain" is my dive into visualizing a vast intelligence that sprawls through space, its structure a mind-bending fractal architecture. This CG-rendered enigma floats in the cosmos, massive and mysterious, evoking a sense of awe and a touch of cosmic intrigue. As a ship approaches with caution, its lights probe the strange formation, hinting at humanity's eternal quest to understand the unfathomable. It's a digital daydream about the wild frontiers of space and the complex entities that could dwell within it, all rendered with a playful nod to the intricate dance of light and geometry.

## Gas Mask

For this gas mask, I dove into a grungy, post-apocalyptic scene, hanging it on the wall like a relic of a rugged past. There's an eerie beauty to these single-filter masks, almost alien in form. I modeled it in Blender before bringing it into Houdini, added textures in Substance, rendered with Redshift, and polished it off with some compositing in Fusion and color grading in Resolve. It's meant to feel like a piece of history left behind in the ruins, still standing guard on a wall of a building that's seen better days.
