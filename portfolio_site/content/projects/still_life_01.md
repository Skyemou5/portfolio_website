## First Project: German-inspired Mushroom Trinket Scene

### Overview
This project draws inspiration from my German upbringing and childhood books. The mushroom model is based on a little trinket from Germany, while the presence of bread evokes memories of the country. It involved meticulous work, focusing on precise modeling and detailed texturing. Care was taken to set up the camera, find high-resolution textures, and add intricate details like fingerprint smudges.

### Tools Used
- **3D Modeling:** Utilized for precise modeling of the mushroom and bread.

- **Texturing:** High-resolution textures were employed to achieve realism.

- **Procedural Shader:** The wooden mushroom utilized an entirely procedural shader.

- **Scattering:** Clever techniques were used to scatter tiny crumbs across the wood floor surface.

- **Compositing:** Use of Fusion and resolve to tweak the colors to give it more of an old film feel.

  ![SA concept](/images/still-life-02/final-skyrim-still-life.png)
{{< /imageGrid >}}

### Overview
This project combines elements from Skyrim and Lovecraftian themes, emphasizing attention to detail. Special focus was placed on creating realistic textures for objects like parchment paper and the inkwell. Lighting played a crucial role in setting the scene, with efforts made to simulate light as if it were coming through a window.

### Tools Used
- **Texturing:** Detailed textures were prepared for objects like parchment paper and the inkwell.
- **Material Design:** Parchment material was designed to take writing texture as a mask, creating a realistic effect.
- **Procedural Effects:** Lots of procedural noise, grunge textures, scratches, and fingerprints were added to achieve realism.
- **Lighting:** Spotlight with texture was used to create light bars as if light were coming through a window.

### Challenges Faced
- Creating realistic textures for parchment paper and the inkwell.
- Designing the parchment material to achieve a realistic look.
- Incorporating imperfections like scratches and fingerprints into textures and meshes.
- Simulating realistic lighting, especially to convey light coming through a window.

### Solutions
- Prepared detailed textures for parchment paper and the inkwell.
- Designed the parchment material to incorporate writing texture as a mask.
- Added imperfections like scratches and fingerprints using procedural noise and grunge textures.
- Used a spotlight with a texture to simulate light bars for a window effect.

### Outcome
The project resulted in a captivating scene that merges elements from Skyrim and Lovecraft, with meticulous attention to detail in textures, lighting, and overall atmosphere.
